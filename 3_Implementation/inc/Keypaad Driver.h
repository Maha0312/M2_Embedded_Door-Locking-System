 *      [3] Setting all the pins of the port that the keypad is connected to.

/***
 * [Purpose] Read the pressed key and return its value.
 *  This method is based on the fact that the only time to get a connection
 *   between a row and a column is by pressing the key connected to both of them.
 * 
 *  1. Setting all the keypadCol pins of the port that the keypad is connected to (pins 4, 5, 6 and 7)
 *  2. Ground one column at a time.
 *  3. Check which row read  0. (This way we can know exactly which key it was that caused the zero)
 *  4. Return the value of the pressed key.
 * 
 * [Arguments] None.
 * [Return Type] Unsigned character.
