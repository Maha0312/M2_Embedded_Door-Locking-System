# INTRODUCTION

Password based Door locking system is a safe and secure access control to use. 

## Aim

To design a Password based door locking system, using Matrix keypad to enter the password.
This project is extended to operate on IR Remote RC-604.

## Features
1. You can enter password through Keypad or IR Remote
2. Low Cost
3. Simple to design
4.Password protected access
5.Eliminates the need to carry a key or any extra remote, as the users phone is used
6.The entire process requires virtually no time



## Research 
Using physical keys to lock or unlock the door is the most natural way and everyone is acquainted with it. The physical key is a well-tested and well-known technology, but it also has its flaws. There can only be one unique key for a lock. For different locks you have different keys. Furthermore, carrying a large number of keys is a burden and increases the chance of keys getting stolen, misplaced or lost.Our goal is to design a solution for secure access control that can replace physical keys for accessing door.
